Google Code downloads feature is quite bad for tracking project adoption and download rates. Basically every time you release even the most minimal incremental release, you have to publish a new download, deprecated the old one, and the download count goes back to zero. This gives the false impression that the project is not as successful as it may be.

So here goes some aggregate data that you can build yourself from the [http://code.google.com/p/moq/downloads/list?can=1 full downloads list]:

Total downloads per version vary as they have been out for different spans of time, but the adoption is steady and fast-growing :). If you aggregate the entire 2.x wave, we've had more than 13k downloads! We hope v3.x wave will make even more strides.
