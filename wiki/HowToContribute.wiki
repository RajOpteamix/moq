We're very open and accept contributions from Moq enthusiasts. 
There are basically two ways of contributing: Contributing a Patch, and Joining the [http://moq-contrib.googlecode.com Moq Contrib Project].

Read the following sections to determine whether you want to contribute as one or the other :)

= Contributing a Patch =

If you just came across a bug which you'd like to fix and contribute back, this is the easiest and less involved way of contributing.

We like the approach outlined in [http://www.instiki.org/show/HowToContribute Instiki]. 
Scott Hanselman has also a good [http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ExampleHowToContributeAPatchToAnOpenSourceProjectLikeDasBlog.aspx overview of how to contribute] using TortoiseSVN (our favorite SVN client). 

Just make sure you replace the repository URL with ours: http://moq.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ (see [http://code.google.com/p/moq/source/checkout] for more info)

We will improve these instructions, hopefully.

= Joining the [http://moq-contrib.googlecode.com Moq Contrib Project] =

Just send an email to the [mailto:moqdisc@googlegroups.com Moq Discussions] list asking to join.


Thanks for your interest in contributing and happy mocking!
