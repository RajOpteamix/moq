Version 1.5
    * Added MockFactory to allow easy construction of multiple mocks with the same behavior and verification  

Version 1.4

    * Added support for passing constructor arguments for mocked classes.
    * Improved code documentation 

Version 1.3

    * Added support for overriding expectations set previously on a Mock. Now adding a second expectation for the same method/property call will override the existing one. This facilitates setting up default expectations in a fixture setup and overriding when necessary in a specific test.
    * Added support for mock verification. Both Verify and VerifyAll are provided for more flexibility (the former only verifies methods marked Verifiable) 

Version 1.2

    * Added support for MockBehavior mock constructor argument to affect the way the mocks expect or throw on calls. 

Version 1.1

    * Merged branch for dynamic types. Now Moq is based on Castle DynamicProxy2 to support a wider range of mock targets.
    * Added ILMerge so that Castle libraries are merged into Moq assembly (no need for external references and avoid conflicts) 

Version 1.0

    * Initial release, initial documentation process in place, etc.
